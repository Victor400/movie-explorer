## Overview

The Interactive Movie Explorer is a responsive, user-friendly web application that allows users to browse, search, filter, and interact with a curated list of movies. Designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site enables users to quickly find movies by title or genre, sort them by release year, and even subscribe to updates or contact the site owner through embedded forms.

## Key Features 

Search Functionality: Quickly find movies by typing keywords into the search bar.

Genre Filtering: Narrow down movie selections by choosing specific genres like Action, Drama, Comedy, or Kids.

Sorting Options: Sort movies by release year in ascending or descending order.

Responsive Design: Optimized for various devices, ensuring a consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Dynamic Rendering: Movie cards are dynamically generated based on user interactions, providing real-time feedback.


## Purpose 

The purpose of the Movie Explorer project is to provide users with an intuitive, searchable, and filterable interface to discover and explore a curated list of movies. It supports different genres and includes edge case handling to test robustness across data-driven scenarios.


## Goal 

- Build a reliable and testable front-end application that displays movies from fixture data.

- Allow filtering by genre (e.g., Action, Kids).

- Integrate automated testing using Cypress to ensure data integrity and user flow reliability.

- Ensure resilience by handling missing or malformed data gracefully in both the UI and tests.

## Flow Steps

Description of Flow Steps:

- Load Homepage: The application initializes and displays the homepage with navigation and search/filter options.

- User Inputs Search Criteria: The user enters a movie title in the search bar, selects a genre from the dropdown menu, and chooses a sort order (e.g., by year ascending or descending).

- Application Processes Input: The application filters the movie dataset based on the search criteria and sorts the filtered list according to the selected order.

- Display Results: The application renders movie cards matching the criteria in the display section.

- User Selects a Movie: The user clicks on a movie card to view more details.

- Display Movie Details: The application shows detailed information about the selected movie description

Future Improvement 

-  User Action: The user may choose to rent the movie, add it to a watchlist, or return to the search results.


## Rationale

Users often face difficulty navigating large collections of movies due to overwhelming options, inconsistent categorization, or missing data. This leads to frustration, poor user experience, and decision fatigue.

Movie Explorer addresses this by offering:

- A clean, filterable interface to explore movies by genre (e.g., Action, Kids), helping users quickly find content that matches their interests.

- Graceful handling of missing or incomplete data (e.g., movies without titles or genre), ensuring the application remains functional and informative even when the dataset isn‚Äôt perfect.

- Automated testing with Cypress, which guarantees reliability of features like genre filtering, loading behavior, and edge case handling‚Äîensuring a trustworthy experience for users.

- A structure that simulates real-world scenarios where applications must perform well despite inconsistent or incomplete backend data.

- By solving both data integrity and user experience challenges, Movie Explorer becomes a robust tool and a strong reference for developers building resilient, user-friendly applications.


## Testing For Project

This project uses **Jest** for unit testing and **Cypress** for end-to-end testing.  
All test-related files are organized under the `/tests` directory.

### üîß Scripts

 For full setup and usage details, see üìò **Test Setup Guide**: [View TESTING.md](tests/setup/TESTING.md)
``` bash
npm test           # Run Jest unit tests
npm run test:watch # Watch mode for Jest
npm run test:e2e   # Launch Cypress test runner
```

## User Experience (UX Design)

### UX Design Considerations

- Consistency: Filter buttons are clearly grouped and responsive across devices.

- Visual Clarity: Movie cards are styled for quick scanning ‚Äì poster, title, genre, and year are prominent.

- Accessibility: Use semantic HTML and alt text for posters to ensure accessibility.

- Navigation: The persistent header with logo and nav menu helps orientation and usability.

- Call to Action: The ‚ÄúSubscribe ‚åÑ‚Äù option is prominent to encourage user engagement.

## Balsamiq Wireframe
I used Balsamiq Wireframes to design and visualize the layout of the Movie Explorer application across multiple device types. The wireframes helped guide the responsive design for:

- Desktop view

- Tablet view

Mobile view

These early-stage sketches served as a blueprint throughout development, ensuring a user-friendly and consistent interface across all screen sizes.
